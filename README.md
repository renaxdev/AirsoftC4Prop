# AirsoftC4Prop
A arduino-driven C4 Prop for an Airsoft match including a defuser kit

I wanted to have a gamemode like in CS:GO to play with my friends so I decided to make this bomb prop thing
You'll need:

--> Bomb
- Arduino (Arduino Uno used here)
- 16x2 IIC LCD
- 2 LEDS
- Button
- Relay

--> Defuser Kit
- Arduino (Arduino Nano used here)
- SSD1306 IIC OLED-Display
- Battery pack
- 2 LED's
- Active Buzzer

I've made this whole project in a few hours so there can be improved alot.
For example the interrupt with the relay isnt really beneficial.
